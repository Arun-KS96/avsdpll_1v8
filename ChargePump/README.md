<h1> 15T Charge Pump with good current matching characteristics based on Self-Cascode Transistor </h1>

<h2> Method of Optimisation: </h2>

* This circuit is adapted from <b> [3] </b> as it claims to provide decent current matching characteristics with minimal number of transistors, and good output impedence. <br>
* The use of SC Transistor in the circuit is optimised for good output impedence by using body biasing and choosing apt transistor sizing as mentioned in <b>[3]</b>. <br>
* Minimum area is kept in mind by using the least 'W' values for transistors wherever possible. <br>
