<h2> Method of Optimisation: </h2>

Minimum area and power consumption is kept in mind by using the least 'W' values for transistors wherever possible.
'W' value for transistors adjacent to the output net is kept slightly high (~1440nm) in order to increase output resistance and in turn the circuits ability provide stable output.
