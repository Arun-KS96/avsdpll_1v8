<h2> Method of Optimisation: </h2>

This circuit for Phase Detector (PD) is adapted from this work <b>[2]</b>. It is chosen because though having a very low transistor count in comparison to generally used PDs this particular PD eliminates deadzone, has a low power consumption and it is capable of working at higher frequencies compared to generally used PDs. <br>
Minimum area and power consumption is kept in mind by using the least 'W' values for transistors wherever possible. <br>
'W' value for transistors adjacent to the output net is kept slightly high (~1440nm) in order to increase output resistance and in turn the circuits ability provide stable output.
