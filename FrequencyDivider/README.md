<h2>Method of Optimisation:</h2>

  In a E-TSPC (Extended True Single Phase Clock) Flip-Flop, it's functionality depends very much on the W/L ratios of the transistors. <br>
  From <b>[1]</b>, It is known that on stage 1 the (W/L)p should be large compared to (W/L)n and in stage 2 and output stage the (W/L)p should be lesser than (W/L)n. <br>
  This and minimum area, power consumption is kept in mind while optimising by use of smallest possible 'W' for transistors wherever possible.
